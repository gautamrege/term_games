# Golang Terminal Games -- just for Fun and Learning! 

This is a repository of games that uses termloop to build games - just for fun! :D

## Why? Why? Why?

Games are the best way to learn while having fun! It challenges your logic as well as you learn new constructs.
If you're getting bored but want to "furn" - (have **fu**n while you lea**rn**) these are great ways to do so! 
If you want to de-focus for a bit but want to keep active, this is the place! 

## Contributing
